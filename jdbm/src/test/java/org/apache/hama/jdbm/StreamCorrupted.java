/**
 * Contributed test case for BTree by Christof Dallermassl (cdaller iicm.edu):
 * <p/>
 * -= quote from original message posted on jdbm-general =-
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * I tried to insert a couple of elements into a BTree and then remove
 * them one by one. After a number or removals, there is always (if more
 * than 20 elements in btree) a java.io.StreamCorruptedException thrown.
 * 
 * The strange thing is, that on 50 elements, the exception is thrown
 * after removing 22, on 200 it is thrown after 36, on 1000 it is thrown
 * after 104, on 10000 it is thrown after 1003....
 * 
 * The full stackTrace is here:
 * ---------------------- snip ------- snap -------------------------
