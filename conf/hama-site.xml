  <property>
    <name>bsp.child.java.opts</name>
    <value>-Xmx2048m</value>
    <description>Java opts for the groom server child processes.  
    The following symbol, if present, will be interpolated: @taskid@ is replaced 
    by current TaskID. Any other occurrences of '@' will go unchanged.
    For example, to enable verbose gc logging to a file named for the taskid in
    /tmp and to set the heap maximum to be a gigabyte, pass a 'value' of:
          -Xmx1024m -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/tmp/@taskid@.gc
    The configuration variable bsp.child.ulimit can be used to control the
    maximum virtual memory of the child processes.

  <property>
    <name>hama.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>master.edward.org</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HAMA_MANAGES_ZK is set in hama-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop zookeeper on.
