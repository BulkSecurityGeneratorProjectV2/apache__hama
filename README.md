# Apache Hama

Apache Hama is a framework for Big Data analytics which uses the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) computing model, which was established in 2012 as a Top-Level Project of The Apache Software Foundation.

It provides not only pure BSP programming model but also SQL-like query interface (Apache MRQL) and vertex/neuron centric programming models, inspired by Google's Pregel and DistBelief (Apache Horn). For the latest information about Hama, please visit our website at: <http://hama.apache.org/>
